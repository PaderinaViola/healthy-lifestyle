    <h1>HEALTHY LIFESTYLE</h1>
    <p>When you're not at your healthiest, you can probably tell. You may simply feel “off.” You may find that you feel tired,
        your digestive system isn't functioning as well as it normally does, and you seem to catch colds.
        Mentally, you may find you can't concentrate and feel anxious or depressed.
        The good news: a healthy lifestyle can help you feel better. Even better, you don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight.
        It's pretty easy to make a couple of small changes that can steer you in the direction of improved well-being.
        And once you make one change, that success can motivate you to continue to make more positive shifts.</p>
    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Eating a balanced diet is essential for maintaining good health. Include a variety of fruits,
        vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your meals.</p>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No matter what your current weight is,
        being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides.
        This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, which lowers your risk of heart and blood vessel, called cardiovascular, diseases.</p>

    <h2>Sleep</h2>
    <p>Sleep is an essential function that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up.
        Healthy sleep also helps the body remain healthy and stave off diseases. Without enough sleep, the brain cannot function properly,
        impairing your abilities to concentrate, think clearly, and process memories.</p>
